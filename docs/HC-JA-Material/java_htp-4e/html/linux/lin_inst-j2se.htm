<h3>System Requirements</h3>
<p>This version of the Java 2 SDK is supported on Intel Pentium platforms
running the Linux kernel v 2.2.12 and glibc v2.1.2-11 or later. A minimum
of 32 megabytes RAM are required. Recommended 48 megabytes of RAM, 16-bit
color mode, KDE and KWM window managers used in conjunction with displays
set to local hosts.

<p>Check your version of glibc using the following command:

<dl>
	<dd><tt><b>ls /lib/libc-*</b></tt>
</dl>

<p>You should have about 75 megabytes of free disk space before attempting
to install the Java 2 SDK software. If you also install the separate documentation
download bundle, you need an additional 125 megabytes of free disk space.

<p>The officially supported Linux platform for J2SDK 1.3.1 is RedHat Linux
6.2, and most testing of J2SDK 1.3.1 for Linux has been conducted on that
operating system. However, J2SDK 1.3.1 has undergone limited testing on
other Linux operating systems. The following table shows the Linux platforms,
by locale, on which Sun has tested this release to at least a limited extent.
See below for information about <a href="#problems">Known Problems</a>

<h3>Known Problems</h3>
<p>RedHat Linux 6.2 is the officially supported Linux platform for J2SDK
1.3.1. Limited testing has been done on other Linux operating systems,
and the following are known problems on the non-supported platforms.

<ul>
	<li>If you use <b>Red Hat Linux 7</b>, we recommend version 7.1 rather than 7.0. Limited testing has revealed problems when using J2SDK with Red Hat Linux 7.0, some of which are described below.</li><br><br>
	<li>When <tt><b>System.exit(int)</b></tt> is invoked on <b>Red Hat 7.0</b>, the program never exits with a non-zero value. This problem is apparently due to a bug in the <tt><b>exit</b></tt> function in <tt><b>libc.so</b></tt> library. To avoid this problem, use the supported Red Hat release, version 6.2, or, if you want to use Red Hat 7, use version 7.1 rather than 7.0.</li><br><br>
	<li>On <b>RedHat Linux 7.0</b>, if you want to use the Classic VM rather than one of the Java HotSpot VMs in J2SDK 1.3.1, you must download and install <tt><b>glibc-2.2-9.i386.rpm</b></tt> file available at <a href="http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHBA-2000-079.html" target="new">http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHBA-2000-079.html</a>. Do <i>not</i> install the i686 files available on that same web page, as those will prevent proper functioning of the Java HotSpot VMs in J2SDK 1.3.1.</li><br><br>
	<li>If you use <b>RedHat Linux 7 Server</b>, you must manually install <tt><b>compat-libstdc++-6.21-2.9.0.0.i386.rpm</b></tt> to prevent "error while loading shared libraries" when using the Java HotSpot VMs. This file is located in the <tt><b>/RedHat/RPMS</b></tt> directory on the RedHat Linux 7 CD-ROM. You may also obtain a copy of this file from <a href="http://rpmfind.net/" target="new">http://rpmfind.net</a>. To install the file, use this command:

	<dl>
		<dd><tt><b>rpm --install compat-libstdc++-6.21-2.9.0.0.i386.rpm</b></tt></dd>
	</dl>

It is not necessary to manually install <tt><b>compat-libstdc++-6.21-2.9.0.0.i386.rpm</b></tt> if you are using RedHat Linux 7 Workstation.</li><br><br>

<li>When using <b>RedHat Linux versions other than 6.1</b>, the <tt><b>font.properties</b></tt> file may fail to display some Symbol/Dingbats characters properly on some AWT components. To correct this, use this revised <tt><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/font.properties" target="new">font.properties</a></tt> file to replace the one at <tt><b>&lt;JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/</b></tt>.</li><br><br>

<li><b>Caldera OpenLinux</b> uses version 2.1.2-3 of glibc. Because that version is not greater than or equal to 2.1.2-11, the Java 2 SDK's rpm installer will fail during its dependency check. We recommend that you obtain an updated version of the glibc library available from Caldera at the following locations:</li>

<dl>
	<dd><a href="ftp://ftp.caldera.com/pub/updates/eDesktop/2.4/current/RPMS/" target="new">ftp.caldera.com:/pub/updates/eDesktop/2.4/current/RPMS</a>
</dl>

</ul>

<h3>Installation Instructions</h3>
<p>The Java&#153; 2 SDK, Standard Edition, v1.3.1 is available in two installation formats. Both files are located in the <b>software-lin\sj-sdk</b> directory on the root level of this CD-ROM.

<ul>
	<li>A self-extracting binary file named <b><tt>j2sdk-1_3_1-linux-i386.bin</tt></b> which can be used to install the Java 2 SDK in any location you choose. If you are using this file, see <b><a href="#self-extracting">Self-Extracting Binary</a></b> below.</li><br><br>
	<li>The file <b><tt>j2sdk-1_3_1-linux-i386-rpm.bin</tt></b> containing RPM packages comprising the Java 2 SDK. If you are using this bundle, see <b><a href="#install-pkg">Installation of RPM File</a></b> below.</li>
</ul>

<p>The bundles for both installation formats are packaged in an <tt><b>.bin</b></tt> shell script that displays the product license agreements before actual installation.

<p>The Java 2 SDK includes the Java Plug-in. See <b><a href="#plugin">Installation of Java Plug-in</a></b> below.

<br><hr>

<a NAME="self-extracting"></a>
<h3>Installation of Self-Extracting Binary</h3>

<p>Use these instructions if you want to use the self-extracting binary file to install the Java 2 SDK. If you want to install RPM packages comprising the SDK, use <a href="#install-pkg">Installation of RPM File</a> below.

<p>The self-extracting binary file (<b>j2sdk-1_3_1-linux-i386.bin</b>) for installing Java&#153; 2 SDK is located in the directory <b>software-lin\sj-sdk</b> on the root level of this CD-ROM. Copy the file from the CD to your hard drive using your favorite graphical or command line tool, then follow the instructions below.

<a NAME="Check"></a>
<p><b>1. Check the download file size.</b>

<dl>
	<dd>Check the large file that you downloaded to ensure that it is the correct size:

	<p><tt><b>j2sdk-1_3_1-linux-i386.bin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26924751 bytes</b></tt>

	<p>If the file size doesn't match, it probably means the file was corrupted during download. In that case, try downloading again.
</dl>

<a NAME="Directory"></a>
<p><b>2. Copy <tt>j2sdk-1_3_1-linux-i386.bin</tt> to the directory into which you want to install the Java 2 SDK.</b>

<a NAME="Directory"></a>
<p><b>3. Run <tt>j2sdk-1_3_1-linux-i386.bin</tt></b>

<dl>
	<dd>Launch the executable file you downloaded, <tt>j2sdk-1_3_1-linux-i386.bin</tt>, by using the following commands from the directory in which it is located:

<dl>
	<dd><tt><b>chmod a+x j2sdk-1_3_1-linux-i386.bin</b></tt>
	<dd><tt><b>./j2sdk-1_3_1-linux-i386.bin</b></tt>
</dl>

<p>The script will display a binary license agreement, which you will be asked
to agree to before installation can proceed. Once you have agreed to the
license, the install script will install the Java 2 SDK in a directory
named <tt><b>jdk1.3.1</b></tt> in the current directory.

<p><b>Note about root access</b> - Unbundling the software automatically
creates a directory called <tt><b>jdk1.3.1</b></tt>. Note that if you choose to
install the Java 2 SDK into system-wide location such as <tt><b>/usr/local</b></tt>,
you must first become root to gain the necessary permissions. If you do
not have root access, simply install the Java 2 SDK into your home directory,
or a subdirectory that you have permission to write to.

<p><b>Note about overwriting files</b> - If you unpack the software or
documentation in a directory that contains a subdirectory named <tt><b>jdk1.3.1</b></tt>,
the new software will overwrite files of the same name in that <tt><b>jdk1.3.1</b></tt>
directory. Please be careful to rename the old directory if it contains
files you would like to keep.
