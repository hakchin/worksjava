<h3>Chapter: 3 Introduction to Java Applets</h3>

	<dl>
<dt>If you have access to the Internet and the World Wide Web, there are a large number of Java applet resources available to you. The best place to start is at the source&#151;the Sun Microsystems, Inc. Java Web site java.sun.com. In the upper-left corner of the Web page is an Applets hyperlink that takes you to the Web page

          <dt><tt><a href="http://www.java.sun.com/applets" target="viewlinks">www.java.sun.com/applets</a></tt> 
          <dd>This page contains a variety of Java applet resources, including free applets you can use on your own World Wide Web site, the demonstration applets from the J2SDK and a variety of other applets (many of which can be downloaded and used on your own computer). There is also a section entitled "Applets at Work" where you can read about uses of applets in industry.
<br>
<br>

          <dt><tt><a href="http://www.developer.java.sun.com/developer" target="viewlinks">www.developer.java.sun.com/developer</a></tt> 
          <dd>On the Sun Microsystems Java Web site, visit the Java Developer Connection. This free site includes technical support, discussion forums, on-line training courses, technical articles, resources, announcements of new Java features, early access to new Java technologies, and links to other important Java Web sites. Even though the site is free, you must register to use it.
<br>
<br>

          <dt><tt><a href="http://www.jars.com" target="viewlinks">www.jars.com</a></tt> 
          <dd>Another useful Web site is JARS&#151;originally called the Java Applet Rating Service. The JARS site calls itself the "#1 Java Review Service." This site originally was a large Java repository for applets. Its benefit was that it rated every applet registered at the site as top 1%, top 5% and top 25%, so you could view the best applets on the Web. Early in the development of the Java language, having your applet rated here was a great way to demonstrate your Java programming abilities. JARS is now all-around resource for Java programmers. <br>
The resources listed in this section provide hyperlinks to many other Java-related Web sites. If you have Internet access, spend some time browsing these sites, executing applets and reading the source code for the applets when it is available. This will help you rapidly expand your Java expertise. Appendix B contains many other Web-based Java resources.

            Java programming. One of its early benefits was the volume of Java 
            source code that was available to the many people learning Java. It 
            is now an all-around Java resource with Java references, free Java

            Early in the development of the Java language, having your applet

            Java Applet Rating Service. The JARS site calls itself the "#1 Java 
            Review Service." This site originated as a large Java repository for 
            applets. Its benefit was that it rated every applet registered at 
            the site as top 1%, top 5% and top 25%, so you could immediately view 
            the best applets on the Web. Early in the development of the Java 
            language, having your applet rated here was a great way to demonstrate 
            your Java programming abilities. JARS is now another all-around resource 
            for Java programmers. <br>

            on specific Java topics. When posting your own questions to a newsgroup, 
            provide specific details of the problem you are trying to solve (such 
            as a problem with a program you are writing). This will enble other 
            people reading the newsgroup to understand your posting and (hopefully) 
            provide a response to you. Be sure to specify a subject heading that 
            clearly states your problem. If you are responding to other people's 
            questions, verify your response before posting it to ensure that the 
            response is correct. Newsgroups should not be used to promote products 
            or services, nor should contact information (such as email addresses 
            for other newsgroup users) be used for unrelated purposes. These are 
            generally not forums for chatting, so posts should be courteous and 
            to the point.<br>
            Normally, newsgroup reader software is required for you to interact 
            with a newsgroup. Such software is provided as part of Netscape Navigator 
            and Microsoft Outlook Express, and there are many other newsgroup 
            software programs available. You also can access newsgroups through 
            the Web. If you do not use newsgroups already, try the Google site.
