<a NAME="requirements"></a><h3>System Requirements</h3>
<p>The Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> 2 SDK is intended for use
on Windows 95, Windows 98 (1st or 2nd edition), Windows NT 4.0 with Service
Pack 5, Windows ME, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows 2000 Server, or
Windows 2000 Advanced Server operating systems running on Intel hardware.
In non-English locales, only the Professional edition of Windows 2000 is
supported.

<p>A Pentium 166MHz or faster processor with at least 32 megabytes of physical
RAM is required to run graphically based applications. Forty-eight megabytes
of RAM is recommended for applets running within a browser using the Java
Plug-in product. Running with less memory may cause disk swapping which
has a severe effect on performance. Very large programs may require more
RAM for adequate performance.

<p>You should have 70 megabytes of free disk space before attempting to
install the Java 2 SDK software. If you also want to install the documentation
download bundle, you will need an additional 120 megabytes of free disk
space.

<br><hr>

<a NAME="install_txt"></a><h3>Installation Instructions</h3>
<p>In this procedure, you will run the self-installing executable to unpack
and install the Java 2 SDK software bundle. 

<p><b>Note:</b> After the Java
2 SDK software has been installed, you will be asked to reboot your system,
which completes the registry modifications that you will need if you ever
want to deinstall this product later. To continue using these instructions
after rebooting, either print them now or use your Web browser's history
function to get back to this page.

<p>The installation procedure has the following steps:

<ol>
	<li><a href="#Check">Check the download file size</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Run">Run the Java 2 SDK installer</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Delete">Delete the downloaded file(s)</a> (Optional)</li>
	<li><a href="#Environment">Update the PATH variable</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Classpath">Check the CLASSPATH variable</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Running">Start using the SDK tools!</a></li>
	<li><a href="#uninstall">Uninstalling the Java 2 SDK</a></li>
</ol>

<!-- ALL LINKS TO SDK DOCS (SUCH AS THE FOLLOWING) NEED TO START WITH "http://java.sun.com/..." SO LINK WILL WORK EVEN IF USER DOWNLOADS THIS PAGE, AND ALSO SO IT WILL WORK FROM FINAL DOWNLOAD PAGE where the installation instructions are shown below the FTP/HTTP download buttons: http://java.sun.com/cgi-bin/download2.cgi#install -->

<p>If you have any difficulties, see the <a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a>
section at the end of this document or use this link to <a href="http://java.sun.com/cgi-bin/feedback.pl" target="new">report
an installation problem</a>.

<a NAME="Check"></a>
<p><b>1. Check the download file size</b>

<dl>
	<dd>If you saved the self-installing executable to disk without
running it from the download page at the Java Software web site, check
to see that you have the complete file:<br><br>

	<dd><b><tt>j2sdk-1_3_1-win.exe &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 34440521 bytes</tt></b><br><br>

	<dd>The file supplied on this CD should be 34440521 bytes as well.
</dl>

<a NAME="Run"></a>
<p><b>2. Run the Java 2 SDK installer</b>

<dl>
	<dd>The file <tt><b>j2sdk-1_3_1-win.exe</b></tt> is the Java 2 SDK installer, 
	double-click on the installer's icon. Then follow the instructions the
installer provides. When done with the installation, you can delete the
download file to recover disk space.
</dl>

<dl>
	<dd><b>Installed Directory Tree</b>

<a NAME="Delete"></a>
<p><b>3. Delete the downloaded file(s)</b> (Optional)
<dl>

	<dd>You will not need to do this if you <a href="#install">install</a> the software directly from the CD.
	<dd>If you want to recover disk space, delete the file (or files) you originally downloaded.<br><br>
	<dd>You will only need to do this if you copied the <tt><b>j2sdk-1_3_1-win.exe</b></tt> file to your harddrive.
</dl>

<a NAME="Environment"></a><a NAME="path"></a>
<p><b>4. Update the PATH variable</b>

<dl>
	<dd>You can run the Java 2 SDK without setting the PATH variable, or you can optionally set it as a convenience.<br><br>
	<dd><b>Should I set the PATH variable?</b>
<br>Set the PATH variable if you want to be able to conveniently run the
Java 2 SDK executables (<tt>javac.exe</tt>, <tt>java.exe</tt>, <tt>javadoc.exe</tt>,
etc.) from any directory without having to type the full path of the command.
If you don't set the PATH variable, you need to specify the full path to
the executable every time you run it, such as:

	<dl>
		<dd><tt>C:> <b>\jdk1.3.1\bin\javac MyClass.java</b></tt>
	</dl>

<p>It's useful to set the PATH permanently so it will persist after rebooting.

<p><a NAME="path-permanent"></a><b>How do I set the PATH permanently?</b>
<br>To set the PATH permanently, add the full path of the <b>jdk1.3.1\bin</b>
directory to the PATH variable. Typically this full path looks something
like <tt><b>C:\jdk1.3.1\bin</b></tt>. Set the PATH as follows, according to whether
you are on Windows NT or Windows 95/98/2000/ME.

<p><b>Windows NT and Windows 2000</b> - To set the PATH permanently:
<ol type=a>
	<li>Choose Settings, Control Panel, and select System. On Windows NT, select
the Environment tab; on Windows 2000 select the Advanced tab. Look for
"Path" in the User Variables and System Variables. If you're not sure where
to add the path, add it to the right end of the "Path" in the User Variables.
A typical value for PATH is:</li>

	<dl>
		<dd><tt><b>C:\jdk1.3.1\bin</b></tt>
	</dl>

<p>Capitalization doesn't matter. Click "Set", "OK" or "Apply".

<p>The PATH can be a series of directories separated by semi-colons (;).
Microsoft Windows looks for programs in the PATH directories in order,
from left to right. You should only have one <tt><b>bin</b></tt> directory for a
Java SDK in the path at a time (those following the first are ignored),
so if one is already present, you can update it to jdk1.3.1.

	<li>The new path takes effect in each new Command Prompt window you open after setting the PATH variable.</li>

</ol>

<p><b>Windows 98, Windows 95</b> - To set the PATH permanently, open the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and add or change the PATH statement as follows:
<ol type=a>
	<li>
	Start the system editor. Choose "Start", "Run" and enter <tt><b>sysedit</b></tt>,
then click <b>OK</b>. The system editor starts up with several windows
showing. Go to the window that is displaying AUTOEXEC.BAT.<br><br></li>

	<li>
	Look for the PATH statement. (If you don't have one, add one.) If you're
not sure where to add the path, add it to the right end of the PATH. For
example, in the following PATH statement, we have added the <tt><b>bin</b></tt>
directory at the right end:</li>

<dl>
	<dd><tt>PATH C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND<b>;C:\JDK1.3.1\BIN</b></tt>
</dl>

<p>Capitalization doesn't matter. The PATH can be a series of directories
separated by semi-colons (;). Microsoft Windows searches for programs in
the PATH directories in order, from left to right. You should only have
one <tt><b>bin</b></tt> directory for a Java SDK in the path at a time (those following
the first are ignored), so if one is already present, you can update it
to jdk1.3.1.

<li>
To make the path take effect in the current Command Prompt window, execute
the following:</li>

<dl>
	<dd><tt>C:> <b>c:\autoexec.bat</b></tt>
</dl>

<p>To find out the current value of your PATH, to see if it took effect, at the command prompt, type:

<dl>
	<dd><tt>C:> <b>path</b></tt>
</dl>

</ol>

<p><b>Windows ME</b> - To set the PATH permanently:

<p>From the start menu, choose programs, accessories, system tools,
and system information. This brings up a window titled "Microsoft Help
and Support". From here, choose the tools menu, then select the system
configuration utility. Click the environment tab, select PATH and press
the edit button. Now add the SDK to your path as described in step b above.
After you've added the location of the SDK to your PATH, save the changes
and reboot your machine when prompted.

</dl>


<a NAME="Classpath"></a>
<p><b>5. Checkthe CLASSPATH variable</b>
<dl>
	<dd>The CLASSPATH variable is one way to tell applications written
in the Java programming language (including the Java 2 SDK utilities) where
to look for user classes (classes that you develop). (The <tt><b>-classpath</b></tt>
command-line switch is the preferred way.) If your machine does not have
the CLASSPATH variable set, you can ignore the rest of this step. To check
this, run the <tt><b>set</b></tt> command from the DOS prompt:

<dl>
	<dd><tt>C:> <b>set</b></tt>
</dl>

<p>If CLASSPATH does not appear in the list of settings, it is not set. If
your CLASSPATH variable is set to some value, you may want to clean up
your CLASSPATH settings, so read on.

<p><b>Should I modify the CLASSPATH variable?</b>
<br>The Java 2 SDK will work fine even if CLASSPATH is set for an earlier
version of the SDK software, as long as it contains the current directory
"<tt><b>.</b></tt>". However, if your CLASSPATH contains <tt><b>classes.zip</b></tt>
(which was only in JDK 1.0.x and JDK 1.1.x), and you don't plan to continue
using those earlier versions, you can remove that setting from the CLASSPATH
now. In any case, if CLASSPATH is set, it should include the current directory
-- this makes it possible to compile and then run classes in the current
directory.

<p><b>How do I modify the CLASSPATH?</b>
<br>Use the same procedure you used for the PATH variable in the previous
step and either:

<ol type="a">
<li>Remove the CLASSPATH environment variable entirely.</li>

<p>With Java 2 SDK, the default value is "<tt>.</tt>", the current directory.
To include any user classes, use the <tt>-classpath</tt> command line switch
instead with <tt>java</tt>, <tt>javac</tt>, <tt>javadoc</tt> and other
tools. This is the recommended approach because it doesn't force one CLASSPATH
for all applications.

<br><br>-OR-

<li>
If you have applications that require CLASSPATH be set, keep those required
user classes in CLASSPATH and include the current directory "<tt>.</tt>"
If you're no longer using JDK 1.1.x, remove <tt>classes.zip</tt>.</li>

</ol>

</dl>

<a NAME="Running"></a>
<p><b>6. Start using the Java 2 SDK!</b>
<dl>
<dd>Your computer system should now be ready to use the Java 2
SDK. In this step, you'll run some simple commands to make sure it is working
properly.

<p>If you are new to developing and running programs in the Java programming
language, see <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/" target="new">The Java
Tutorial</a> online for some guidance. Note especially the tutorial trails
under the heading <i>Trails Covering the Basics</i>.

<p>You can also <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/index.html" target="new">download
the Java 2 SDK documentation from the Java 2 SDK download page.</a>.

</dl>

<p><a NAME="uninstall"></a><b>7. Uninstalling the Java 2 SDK</b>
<dl>
	<dd>If you should ever want to uninstall the Java 2 SDK, go to
the Start menu and select Settings, then select Control Panel. In the Control
Panel, open the Add/Remove Programs utility. You will be presented with
a list of software that you can uninstall. Simply choose the Java 2 SDK
from the list and click the "Add/Remove..." button.

<br><hr>
<a NAME="troubleshooting"></a>
<h3>Troubleshooting the Installation</h3>

<p>Below are some tips for working around problems that are sometimes seen
during or following an installation. For more troubleshooting information,
see the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/faq.html" target="new">Java FAQ</a>.

<ul type=disc>
<li><b>"Damaged" ActiveX Control file</b></li>

<p>When you install version 1.3.1 of the Java Runtime Environment, the
ActiveX Control file at <tt><b>C:\Winnt\Downloaded Program Files\Java Runtime
Environment 1.3.1</b></tt> will have a status of "Damaged." This is merely
a cosmetic issue, and the "Damaged" status should have no adverse affect
in any situation.

<p>Nevertheless, there is a workaround if for some reason you cannot have
a status of damaged. Go to "Start -> Run" and type in "regedit". From the
regedit windows, navigate to the registry key "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Code
Store Database\Distribution Units\8AD9C840-044E-11D1-B3E9-00805F499D93\DownloadInformation".
Double-click on the INF string and delete the highlighted string under
"Value data". The ActiveX Control file will have a status of "Installed."

<li>
<b>Installer says you don't have enough disk space, even though you have
more than 4GB free space available</b>

</li>

<p>This problem can occur if the free space on your disk is in the narrow
range [4GB, 4GB + required space -1]. To workaround this problem, create
a temporary file (or files) that take up enough disk space to make the
free space less than 4GB, then proceed with the installation. After the
installation is completed, you may delete the temporary file(s).
<p>A similar problem may occur with larger amounts of free disk space.
See bug report <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4406594.html" target="new">4406594</a>.<br><br>

<li><b>If you see the following error message on Windows 2000</b></li>

<dl>
	<dd><tt><b>config.nt.</b></tt> The system file is not suitable for running MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows Applications.
</dl>

<p>it indicates a problem with the %SystemRoot%\System32\COMMAND.COM file
that has been seen on some installations of Windows 2000. If you encounter
this error message when you try to launch the installer, consult the Microsoft
web site at

<dl>
<dd><tt><b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q142/2/71.asp" target="new">http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q142/2/71.asp</a></b></tt> for information about resolving the problem.
</dl>

<li><b>If you see the following error message</b></li>

<dl>
	<dd><tt><b>corrupt cabinet file</b></tt>
</dl>

<p>then the file you have downloaded is corrupted. (A cabinet file contains
compressed application, data, resource and DLL files.) Check its file size
against the expected file size listed in these instructions. If they don't
match, try downloading the bundle again.

<li><b>If you see the following error message</b></li>

<dl>
	<dd><tt><b>net.socketException: errno = 10047</b></tt>

	<p>-or-
	
	<dd><tt><b>Unsupported version of Windows Socket API</b></tt>
</dl>

<p>check which TCP/IP drivers you have installed. The AppletViewer supports
only the Microsoft TCP/IP drivers included with Windows 95. If you are
using third-party drivers (e.g., Trumpet Winsock), you'll need to change
over to the native Microsoft TCP/IP drivers if you want to load applets
over the network.<br><br>

<li><b>If you see the following error message</b></li>

<dl>
	<dd><tt><b>System Error during Decompression</b></tt>
</dl>

<p>then you might not have enough space on the disk that contains your TEMP directory.

<li><b>If you see the following error message</b></li>

<dl>
	<dd><tt><b>This program cannot be run in DOS mode.</b></tt>
</dl>

<p>then do the following:

<ol>
	<li>Open the MS-DOS shell (Windows/Start/Programs/MS-DOS Prompt)</li>
	<li>Right-click on the title bar</li>
	<li>Select Properties</li>
	<li>Choose the Program tab</li>
	<li>Push the Advanced button</li>
	<li>Make sure the item "Prevent MS-DOS-based programs from detecting Windows" is unchecked</li>
	<li>Select OK</li>
	<li>Select OK again</li>
	<li>Exit the MS-DOS shell</li>
	<li>Restart your computer.</li>
</ol>

<li><b>If the AppletViewer does not load applets</b></li>

<br>then you might try the following:

<ol>
	<li>set HOMEDRIVE=c:
	<p>set HOMEPATH=\
	<p>and restart the AppletViewer (in the same Command Prompt window)</li>

<li>set HOME=c:\</li>

<p>and restart the AppletViewer (in the same Command Prompt window)</ol>
If none of these work, try:

<dl>
	<dd>java -verbose sun.applet.AppletViewer
</dl>

<p>This lists the classes that are being loaded. From this output, you can
determine which class the AppletViewer is trying to load and where it's
trying to load it from. Check to make sure that the class exists and is
not corrupted in some way.

<li><b>Appletviewer locks up</b></li>

<p>This happens with NT Workstation 4.0, update 3, where the DISPLAY is
configured for "true color". The appletviewer (and perhaps other entities)
will lock up by running and then freezing the system consuming 100% CPU.
<br>To "test" this run the "java -verbose sun.applet.AppletView" and notice
that it locks up when it tries to run the MTookit.class.

<a NAME="winsock"></a>
<li><b>Winsock Issues</b></li>

<p>The Java 2 SDK does not include Microsoft Winsock 2.0. It is extremely
likely that your system already has Winsock 2.0. Windows NT 4.0, Windows,
ME, Windows 2000, and Windows 98 come with Winsock 2.0. Windows 95 comes
with Winsock 1.1 or 1.2, but most Windows 95 systems have been upgraded
to Winsock 2.0 by now.

<p>To check which version of Winsock you have, search for "winsock.dll".
Then choose "Properties" from the File menu and click the Version tab.

<p>You can download the Winsock 2.0 from this address:

<dl>
	<dd><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/contents/wuadmintools/s_wunetworkingtools/w95sockets2/" target="new">http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/contents/wuadmintools/s_wunetworkingtools/w95sockets2/</a></blockquote>
</dl>

<p>The following URL contains information about how to determine if the Winsock 2.0 components are installed on a Windows 95 platform:

</dl>

<a NAME="notepad"></a>
<li><b>Creating Source Files in Notepad</b>

<p>In Microsoft Windows, when you
create a new file in Microsoft Notepad and then save it for the first time,
Notepad normally adds the <tt><b>.txt</b></tt> extension to the filename. Therefore,
a file you name <tt><b>Test.java</b></tt> is saved as <tt><b>Test.java.txt</b></tt>.
It's important to note that you cannot see the <tt>.txt</tt> extension
unless you turn on the viewing of file extensions (in Windows Explorer,
uncheck "Hide file extensions for known file types" under Folder Options).
To prevent the <tt><b>.txt</b></tt> extension, enclose the filename in quotation
marks, such as <tt><b>"Test.java"</b></tt>, when typing it into the Save As dialog
box.</li>

<p>On the other hand, Microsoft WordPad does not add a file extension if
you provide one -- you must save the file as "Text Document".
