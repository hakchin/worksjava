아래 것은 중요하다. 이것을 몰라서 무척 헤메었다.
Lena,
It is not stated clearly in the article what the project name should be and you probably used other name for project than "ContactList". In this case it is easy to fix.

1. open web.xml and map servlet "contacts" servlet to your entry point class, but in url-pattern use your projects name instead of "contactlist" like this: <url-pattern>/your_app_name/contacts</url-pattern>

2. open YouProjectName.html file end replace default table with code from the article.

3. open YouProjectName.gwt.xml and replace default entry point maping with mapping to yours entry point

4. Compile project with your entry point selected

5. Start GWT project and select YouProjectName.html 

It should work
